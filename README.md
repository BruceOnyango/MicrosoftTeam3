1. **Improving access to healthcare in Africa**
2. **Shortage of trained personnel in Africa**

**Problem Statement**

A solution that:

1. **Data collection and processing in hospitals**

*Develop a AI-based data processing solution that will help healthcare institutions and hospitals to study analyse, share a patient’s medical records and derive insights that can support medical intervention. Using Deep Neural Networks, robust computational processing, and machine learning, the data processing solution should help medical personnel to streamline their workflows and better manage patient care.*

2. **Access to comprehensive virtual healthcare in remote areas**

*Build a solution that enables doctors to gain real-time access to a patient’s vital signs from anywhere in the world. The solution should allow doctors to gauge a patient’s condition to determine whether hospitalization is necessary. The solution can also provide general medical assistance and will be especially useful in cases of emergencies.*
